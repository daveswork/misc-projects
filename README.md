# Misc scripts that have helped me with some chores.



## Python 2.7


- flat-file-parser.py this takes a file with fixed length fields and converts it
into a csv file. Super handy when there are over 100 fields to split. 

- course-directories.py this generates a bunch of empty directories for me to work in. 
Mostly useful when I take a Udemy course and want to keep work for each section in their directory.

## Python 3.6+

- aws_inventory takes an AWS username, prompts for credentials and gives a list of accounts, or something like that.
